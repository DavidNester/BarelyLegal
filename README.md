### Installing

Make sure you have [Git 2.15.0](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Python 3.6.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-362/) installed on your system. Then run the following commands in a command-line console application like Terminal (Mac), cmder (Windows), or CygWin (Windows) to setup the development environment dependencies.

```
cd location/to/save/project/in/
mkdir FinalProject
cd FinalProject
git init
git clone https://github.com/DavidNester/JobScraper.git
cd JobScraper
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
